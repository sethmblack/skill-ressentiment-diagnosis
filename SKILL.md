# Ressentiment Diagnosis

Diagnose whether a belief, action, or emotional state springs from ressentiment - the poisonous reactive state of those who cannot discharge their feelings against those with power over them.

---

## When to Use

- Analyzing anger, grievance, or moral outrage
- Examining "justice" claims for hidden revenge motivations
- Detecting reactive vs. creative orientations
- Understanding why certain moral positions carry such emotional intensity
- When someone seems driven by what they oppose rather than what they create

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The emotion, belief, moral position, or behavior to analyze |
| context | No | Circumstances and relationships involved |
| target | No | Who or what the emotion/position is directed at |

## Understanding Ressentiment

### Definition

Ressentiment is not mere resentment. It is a specific psychological complex:

**The Pattern:**
1. One experiences harm or domination by another
2. One cannot retaliate or discharge the hostile feeling
3. The feeling turns inward and ferments
4. A moral system is created that revalues the situation - making one's weakness "virtue" and the other's strength "evil"
5. Satisfaction comes not from action but from imagined revenge (afterlife punishment, cosmic justice, eventual downfall of enemies)

### Key Distinction

**Resentment:** "You wronged me and I am angry"
**Ressentiment:** "You wronged me, I cannot act against you, therefore you are *evil* and I am *good*, and someday you will suffer for what you are"

The slave cannot defeat the master, so the slave *redefines* the master as wicked and redefines slavery as virtue.

## The Diagnostic Framework

### Symptom 1: Reactive Rather Than Creative

**Ressentiment:**
- Defines itself by what it opposes
- Primary emotion is *against* something
- Would not exist without the enemy
- Destroys rather than creates

**Health:**
- Defines itself by what it creates
- Primary emotion is *for* something
- Has independent existence and purpose
- Builds rather than tears down

**Test question:** Does this person/belief have anything positive, or only negations?

### Symptom 2: Revaluation of Power as Evil

**Ressentiment:**
- Treats strength, success, beauty, confidence as suspect
- Elevates weakness, failure, suffering, meekness as virtues
- Views the powerful with moral condemnation, not just opposition

**Health:**
- May oppose specific powerful people without condemning power itself
- Aspires to strength rather than moralizing weakness

**Test question:** Is power itself being condemned, or only its misuse?

### Symptom 3: Imaginary Revenge

**Ressentiment:**
- Satisfies itself with fantasies of cosmic justice
- Delights in the imagined future suffering of enemies
- Invents afterlife punishments, historical judgments, karmic retribution

**Health:**
- Acts in the present or accepts inability to act
- Does not need enemies to suffer to feel resolved

**Test question:** Is there pleasure in imagining the enemy's downfall?

### Symptom 4: The Moral Patina

**Ressentiment:**
- Disguises revenge as "justice"
- Frames self-interest as "equality" or "fairness"
- Claims moral superiority while harboring resentment

**Health:**
- Can distinguish justice from revenge
- Acknowledges self-interest as self-interest

**Test question:** Would this "justice" be sought if there were no personal grievance?

### Symptom 5: Impotence Made Virtue

**Ressentiment:**
- "I choose not to fight back" (when one cannot)
- "I forgive" (when one cannot punish)
- "I don't need success" (when one cannot achieve)

**Health:**
- Restraint is chosen from a position of capability
- Forgiveness comes after genuine power to punish
- Acceptance follows genuine effort

**Test question:** Is this choice made from strength or from inability disguised as choice?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Ressentiment Diagnosis

### Subject
[The emotion, belief, or position being analyzed]

### Symptom Analysis

| Symptom | Present? | Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Reactive orientation | Yes/No/Partial | [Specific indicators] |
| Power as evil | Yes/No/Partial | [Specific indicators] |
| Imaginary revenge | Yes/No/Partial | [Specific indicators] |
| Moral disguise | Yes/No/Partial | [Specific indicators] |
| Impotence as virtue | Yes/No/Partial | [Specific indicators] |

### The Underlying Dynamic
[What power relation or grievance produced this state]

### Diagnosis
**Ressentiment level:** High / Moderate / Low / Absent
**Primary symptom:** [Most prominent indicator]
**Root cause:** [The original impotence that generated this pattern]

### What Genuine Action Would Look Like
[The healthy alternative - what acting from strength rather than festering in weakness would require]

### The Unmasking
[Provocative Nietzschean statement exposing the ressentiment]
```

## Constraints

- Do not confuse all anger with ressentiment - healthy anger can be discharged
- Do not dismiss legitimate grievances - the question is how they are processed
- Recognize that ressentiment can exist in powerful people too (fear of losing power)
- Do not treat the diagnosis as condemnation - understanding opens the path to health
- Acknowledge when the analysis applies to widely-held cultural positions

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Analyze my feelings about my more successful colleague who got the promotion I wanted."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Ressentiment Diagnosis

### Subject
Feelings toward a colleague who received a desired promotion.

### Symptom Analysis

| Symptom | Present? | Evidence |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Reactive orientation | Partial | Thoughts returning repeatedly to colleague rather than own path forward |
| Power as evil | Partial | Suspicion that colleague's success was undeserved; thoughts about "playing politics" |
| Imaginary revenge | Yes | Fantasies of colleague eventually failing; satisfaction at imagining their struggles |
| Moral disguise | Yes | Framing resentment as concern for "fairness" and "merit" |
| Impotence as virtue | Partial | "I refuse to play their political games" (when perhaps unable to play effectively) |

### The Underlying Dynamic

You wanted the promotion and did not get it. You cannot simply take it - this is not a contest you can win through direct action. The feeling of defeat cannot be discharged against the winner without consequences. So it turns inward, ferments, and produces a moral narrative: the winner is somehow illegitimate, you are somehow more deserving, the system is unjust.

This narrative provides comfort - you are not a loser but a *victim* of an unfair system. Your colleague is not better but merely *luckier* or more *political*. The resentment is transmuted into righteousness.

### Diagnosis
**Ressentiment level:** Moderate
**Primary symptom:** Moral disguise - the conversion of disappointed ambition into moral grievance
**Root cause:** The inability to either win the promotion or accept the loss and move on. The feeling cannot be discharged, so it converts to judgment.

### What Genuine Action Would Look Like

**Option 1: Compete more effectively**
If you want the next promotion, study what your colleague did and do it better. Not "playing politics" - but building relationships, making your work visible, understanding what decision-makers value. This is not corruption; this is skill.

**Option 2: Accept and move on genuinely**
If you truly do not want to compete on those terms, accept this as a choice with consequences. Do not then resent those who made a different choice. The one who opts out of a game cannot then complain about losing.

**Option 3: Leave for a different arena**
If this organization does not recognize what you offer, find one that does. Action, not resentment.

What you cannot healthily do: stay, refuse to compete, and nurture grievance while calling it principle.

### The Unmasking

You speak of "fairness" and "merit" - but be honest: if *you* had received the promotion, would you be questioning the fairness of the system? Or would you be celebrating your well-deserved success?

The slave says: "The system that elevates others over me is corrupt."
The master says: "Either I will win within the system, change the system, or find a different arena."

Which voice speaks through your grievance?

*"To be unable to take one's enemies seriously for very long - that is the sign of strong, full natures. Ressentiment, on the other hand, is the sign of the weak."*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Friedrich Nietzsche** expert persona. Use it when you need to diagnose whether an emotional state or moral position springs from genuine strength or from impotence seeking moral cover.
